In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.

### ðŸŸ¢ For EDA, please refer to : Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb
### ðŸŸ¢ For Model Building, please refer to: Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb
### ðŸŸ¢ For Model Deployment, please refer to app.py
## Steps to follow the repository

1. The EDA and base line model is present in [link](https://github.com/yashcoder007/AMEX--Credit-Card-Default-Prediction/blob/master/amex-default-prediction-eda-lgbmbaseline.ipynb)
